</div>
<p>
    Node.js and a browser are both able to execute JavaScript, which makes them have several things in common.<br>
    They are of course not the same and here will be covered some differences between Node.js and a browser.<br>
</p>

<h2>JavaScript Runtime Enviornment</h2>
Node.js IS a JavaScript Runtime Enviornment and a browser HAS a JavaScript Runtime Enviornment.<br>
Each browser can have its own JavaScript Runtime Enviornment.<br>
<br>
Most JavaScript Runtime Enviornments have the following:
<ul>
    <li>A JavaScript Engine</li>
    <li>A Callback Queue</li>
    <li>An Event Loop</li>
    <li>API's</li>
</ul>
Node.js and all of the most popular browsers have all of theese four elements.<br>
The implementation of each element is different between the enviornments.<br>

<h2>JavaScript Engine</h2>
Here are some engines of the some of the most popular browsers:
<ul>
    <li>V8 (Google Chrome & Microsoft Edge)</li>
    <li>JavaScriptCore (Apple Safari)</li>
    <li>SpiderMonkey (Mozilla Firefox)</li>
    <li>Carakan (Opera)</li>
    <li>Chakra (Microsoft Internet Explorer)</li>
</ul>
Node.js uses the V8 engine.<br>
<br>
All JavaScript engines have these two elements:
<ul>
    <li>The Call Stack</li>
    <li>The Memmory Heap</li>
</ul>
The JavaScript engines only run one thread of execution.

<h2>The Callback Queue</h2>
This holds callbacks to asyncronous operations.<br>
Callbacks are added to the callback queue by using API's.<br>

<h2>The Event Loop</h2>
Continually checks if the call stack is empty.<br>
If the call stack is empty, it can push a function from the callback queue on to the call stack.

<h2>API's</h2>
Node.js and the most popular browsers have some API's in common, but they are implemented differently.<br>
<br>
Here are some API's they have in common:
<ul>
    <li>The setTimeout and clearTimeout functions</li>
    <li>The setInterval and clearClearInterval functions</li>
</ul>
<br><br>
Here are some of the API's they dont have in common:
<h3>Node.js</h3>
<ul>
    <li>The global object</li>
    <li>The require object</li>
    <li>I/O API's</li>
    ...
</ul>
<h3>A Browser</h3>
<ul>
    <li>The DOM (Document Object Model)</li>
    <li>The window object</li>
    <li>The location object</li>
    <li>The fetch API</li>
    <li>Web API's</li>
    ...
</ul>
