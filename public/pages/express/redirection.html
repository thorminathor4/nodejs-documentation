<h1>Express - Redirection</h1>
<p>
    You can redirect an HTTP response from a route to another endpoint with an express server.<br>
    To see how to make an express server, go to one of this guide: <a href="/create-a-server">Create a Server</a>.<br>
    See how to make routes here: <a href="/create-a-route">Create a Route</a>.
</p><br>
To redirect a response, use the redirect method on the respone object and give it the endpoint/path to redirect to as a string<br>
(This this will redirect the response from the route that recieves a get request to the route of the endpoint "/frontpage"):<br>
