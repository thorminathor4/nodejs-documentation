<h1>Express - Router</h1>
<p>
    Instead of defining every route on a server by using a method on the server object, you can make a router and use it on the server.<br>
    To see how to make an express server, go to this guide: <a href="/create-a-server">Create a Server</a>.<br>
    See how to make routes here: <a href="/create-a-route">Create a Route</a>.<br>
    A router has the same methods for defining routes as the server object.<br>
</p>
This is a guide on how to make a router and use it on the server.<br>
<ol>
    <li>
        It is a good idea to make a router in a module.<br>
        See more about modules here:
        <a href="/importing-exporting-modules">Importing & Exporting Modules</a>.<br>
        If you make the router in a module you can:
        <ul>
            <li>Export just the router object, so you get the router object directly when you import the module.</li>
            <li>Export an object with the router object as a property, so you can get the router from that property of the object you get, when you import the module.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        Make a new router object by using the Router method on the express module object.<br>
        <p class="codeblock">
            <span class="blue">const</span>
            <span class="aqua">router</span>
            <span class="white">=</span>
            <span class="beige">express</span><span class="white">.</span><span class="beige">Router</span><span class="white">();</span>
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        Make one or more routes. See how to make routes here: <a href="/create-a-route">Create a Route</a>.
    </li>
    <li>
        Use the router on the server by using the use method tn the server object and giving it the router object as parameter:<br>
        <p class="codeblock">
            <span class="aqua">app</span><span class="white">.</span><span class="beige">use</span><span class="white">(</span><span class="aqua">router</span><span class="white">);</span>
        </p><br>
        When the server uses a router, the server has all the routes that the router has.
    </li>
