<h3>Install Node.js</h3>

<h3>Execute A JavaScript File</h3>
When you have installed Node.js, you can start executing JavaScript files.<br>
You can execute a JavaScript file from a terminal by writing node followed by the filename<br>
(Here the file "app.js" is executed with node):<br>
<p class="codeblock">
    <span class="yellow">node</span>
    <span class="white">app.js</span>
</p><br>
If you use the log method on the console object in the file, the text will show in the terminal, where the file has been executed.<br>
(For example if you log "Hello World!" like this):<br>
<p class="codeblock">
    <span class="sky">console</span><span class="white">.</span><span class="beige">log</span><span class="white">(</span><span class="red">"Hello World!"</span><span class="white">);</span>
