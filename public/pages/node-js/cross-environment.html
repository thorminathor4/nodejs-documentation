<p>
    The "cross-env" module provides the ability to run platform specific commands across all platforms.<br>
</p>

<h3>Install Cross-Env</h3>
See how to install modules here: <a href="/npm-and-projects">NPM & Projects</a>.

<h3>Use Cross-Env</h3>
When you have installend Cross-Env, you can execute a command from another platform.<br>
This is done by making a script in the package of a project, where "cross-env" is prepended to the command of the script<br>
(Here the script "start" uses "cross-env" to run the command following "cross-env"):<br>
<p class="codeblock">
    <span class="sky">"scripts"</span><span class="white">:</span>
        <span class="white">{</span><br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="sky">"start"</span><span class="white">:</span>
    <span class="red">"cross-env PORT=3000 node app.js"</span><br>
    <span class="white">}</span>
</p><br>
The script above sets an environment variable. Read more about that here:
