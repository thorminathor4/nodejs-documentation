<h1>REST API</h1>
<p>
    A REST API is a Web API that support CRUD operations for a ressource type.<br>
    REST is an abbreviation for Representational State Transfer.<br>
    A REST API has a state which it can transfer representations of.<br>
    A client can request a repressentation of the state, that a REST API is in, so it transfers the repressentation to the client.<br>
    A client can also transfer a repressentation of a state to the server, it wants the REST API to be in.<br>
    CRUD operations are the following operations: Create, Read, Update and Delete.<br>
</p>
A REST API should meet the following requirements:
<ul>
    <li>The ressource type should be a noun.</li>
    <li>The endpoints should use the ressource type as a plural noun.</li>
    <li>Each ressource should have a unique id.</li>
    <li>A unique id should be assigned to each ressource upon creation.</li>
    <li>The id's of the ressources should never be changed.</li>
</ul>
The table below shows the following:
<ul>
    <li>Which operations the REST API should be able to perform.</li>
    <li>Which HTTP method maps to which CRUD operation.</li>
    <li>What the endpoint of each operation should be.<br>
        (id should be a path variable).
    </li>
</ul>
<p>(This is how a REST API for users should be defined):</p>
