</div>
<p>
    In JavaScript there are different ways to declare a variable.<br>
    Here are some differences between declaring variables using the three keywords.
</p>
<h2 class="code-header aqua">const</h2>
<p>
    Declares and defines a block-scoped variable, that must be initialized when declared and can not be reassigned.<br>
    If the variable is initialized to an object/array, the properties/values inside the object/array can be manipulated including reassignment.<br>
    Using the variable before it's initialisation will throw a ReffernceError.<br>
    When declared in an inner scope, with the same name as a variable in the outer scope, the variable from the outer scope can not be accessed in that inner scope.<br>
    Should always be used, when reassignment is not nessesary.
</p>
<h2 class="code-header aqua">let</h2>
<p>
    Declares and defines a block-scoped variable, that can be reassigned and where no initialization is required.<br>
    If declared without initialisation, its value will be initialized to undefined until assigned to another value.<br>
    Using the variable before it's initialisation will throw a ReffernceError.<br>
    When declared in an inner scope, with the same name as a variable in the outer scope, the variable from the outer scope can not be accessed in that inner scope.<br>
    Should only be used, when either:
    <ul>
        <li>It can not be initialized when it is declared.</li>
        <li>Reassignment is nessesary.</li>
    </ul>
</p>
<h2 class="code-header aqua">var</h2>
<p>
    AVOID USING THIS!<br>
    Declares a hoisted variable, that can be reassigned with it's where no initialization is required.<br>
    Hoisting means the variable is declared and initialized to undefinded in the start of it's scope.<br>
    When used inside a function, it declares a local variable scoped to the function.<br>
    If not declared inside a function, it declares a global variable.<br>
    When declared in a function, with the variable name being the same as a global variable, the global variable can not be accessed in that function.<br> 
    It also permits redeclaration of variables.<br>
</p>
<br>
<p>
    You can also declare non hoisted global variables by initializing them without a keyword.<br>
    This is only possible, if the variable is not already defined.
