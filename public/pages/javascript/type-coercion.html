    <h1 class="page-title">JavaScript - Type Coercion</h1>
</div>
<p>
    Type coercion is when values are converted automatically.<br>
    Coercion happens in specific cases using certain operation.<br>
    (There is not an explantion for when and how each operation coerces the values, because that requires a considerably long explanation).
</p>
<br>
To avoid coercion, do the following:
<ul>
    <li>Convert values explicitly</li>
    <li>Avoid using operations that can coerce values if possible</li>
</ul>
<h2>Non Coercing Operators</h2>
<h3>Strict (in)equality (===, !==)</h3>
<h2>Coercing Operators</h2>
Below are some operations that can coerce values:
<h3>Concationation (+)</h3>
The + operator can coerce values into strings and concatenate them.
<h3>Addition (+)</h3>
The + operator can coerce values into numbers (or *NaN) and add them.
<h3>Math operators (-, *, /, %)</h3>
Math operators can coerce values into numbers to perform the math operation.
<h3>Loose (in)equality (==, !=)</h3>
The loose (in)equality operator can coerce values which allows for loose (in)equality, which means:
<ul>
    <li>Matching types is not required for loose equality.</li>
    <li>Non matching types does not always result in loose inequality.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Relational operators (&gt;, &gt;=, &lt;, &lt;=)</h3>
Relational operators can coerce values into numbers (or *NaN) and compare them.<br>
<br>
*NaN means "Not a Number", but is actually has the type Number.
