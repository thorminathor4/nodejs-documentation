    <h1 class="page-title">JavaScript - Increment & Decrement Operator</h1>
</div>
<p>
    The increment (++) and decrement (--) operators work differently, depending on how they are used.<br>
    You can use them as either prefix or postfix to a variable, which decides when the operation happens.<br>
</p>
<h3>Prefix</h3>
When you use the operator as prefix to a variable name, the operation happens "before" other operations.<br>
That means if the operator is used in an expression, the operation happens before the other operations in the expression.
<h3>Postfix</h3>
When you use the operator as postfix to a variable name, the operation happens "after" other operations.<br>
That means if the operator is used in an expression, the operation happens after the other operations in the expression.
